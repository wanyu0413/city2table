# City2Table

City2Table is a unique app that connects food lovers with talented local chefs in their city. With just a few taps, users can browse and book courses made by chefs who will come to their home and cook a delicious meal. As a user, you can choose from a variety of cuisines and dietary preferences, and even customize the menu with the chef. And if you're a chef, you can easily create and list your courses, setting your own prices and availability. City2Table is the perfect way to discover new flavors, support local businesses, and enjoy a one-of-a-kind culinary experience in the comfort of your own home.
